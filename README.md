# SolidWorks Projects

This repository is a portfolio of SolidWorks designs and CAD models I've created while studying Mechanical Engineering. Each folder contains an individual project with its own README for details.

## Projects

- **Parallel Jaw Clamp**  
  A parametric clamp model designed in SolidWorks, including part models and assemblies.

*(More projects will be added as I complete them.)*

## Tools Used
- SolidWorks (part modeling, assemblies, drawings)
- GitHub for version control and portfolio hosting

## About Me
I am a Mechanical Engineering student (GPA 3.8) with interests in design, fabrication, and computational tools like Python. You can learn more about me on my [resume](/Resume.pdf).
