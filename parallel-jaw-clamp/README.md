# Parallel Jaw Clamp

This project is a SolidWorks model of a parallel jaw clamp. The goal was to practice creating assemblies with moving parts and applying realistic constraints.

## Features
- Fully modeled parts and subassemblies
- Parametric design (dimensions can be adjusted easily)
- Motion study demonstrating clamp operation
- Technical drawings with tolerances
