# Parallel Jaw Clamp

This project is a SolidWorks model of a parallel jaw clamp. The technical drawings were sourced from a tutorial, but the 3D modeling, assemblies, and mating were completed independently. The purpose of this project was to practice parametric modeling and gain experience assembling moving mechanical parts in SolidWorks.

## What I Did
- Modeled all clamp components in SolidWorks from technical drawings  
- Applied mates to build a functional assembly  
- Simulated motion to verify clamp movement  
- Practiced parametric design for adjustable dimensions  

## What Was Provided
- Technical drawings and dimensions (from tutorial reference only)

## Skills Learned
- SolidWorks part modeling and assemblies  
- Applying mates and constraints  
- Simulating mechanical movement  
- Translating 2D drawings into 3D parametric models
